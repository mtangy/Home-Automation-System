# Home-Automation-System
A home automation system to control various aspects of my room and home. The system is mostly written in python with a webpage interface written in HTML and PHP.  
Currently the only hardware components being used are 3 relay's a light sensor module base on a light dependent resistor, an HC-SR04 ultrasonic module and a LM34 analog temperature sensor. 
Right now the system only controls my window air condition unit but will later control my TV and lamp.
